# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from 37 v1 requirements; v2 resources (Suppliers, Offers, Vouchers) deferred
- [Roadmap]: OAuth consent onboarding (Phase 4) separated from node package phases; depends only on Phase 1
- [01-01]: Used preAuthentication pattern (proven in Metabase) for automatic token caching with expirable hidden field
- [01-01]: 18 Fortnox scopes as multiOptions with 5 core defaults (companyinformation, invoice, customer, article, order)
- [01-01]: URL-encoded string body with encodeURIComponent for scope parameter in token request

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: `preAuthentication` pattern reliability in current n8n versions needs validation. Fallback: manual token fetch in `execute()`.
- Phase 4: n8n webhook workflow for OAuth callback -- JWT decoding without external libraries needs investigation.
